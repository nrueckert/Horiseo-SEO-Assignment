# Week 1 Assignment

## This is an assignment where I had to reverse engineer a website and fix some html/css and make it semantic.

 

- My motivation was to improve at coding and finish way before the deadline.
- I reverse engineered this project to better understand coding.
- I solved the problem of allowing it to be more understandable and accessible.
- I learned how to better understand and work with code that I haven't seen before.

## Usage

You open the .html in a browser and can see the semantic HTML in inspect.<br>
